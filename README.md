# Hello, I'm Norman Zvenyika

A multidisciplinary student majoring in Computer Science and Bioengineering, complemented by minors in Economics, Data Science, and Population Health, I possess a diverse skill set that enables me to tackle complex problems from various angles. My expertise in machine learning, data engineering, and software engineering, coupled with a strong foundation in biomedical research, equips me with a comprehensive understanding of both the technical and societal aspects of my endeavors. As I advance in my academic journey and professional pursuits, I am enthusiastic about leveraging my interdisciplinary background to create meaningful, positive change in the world.

This summer, I'm immersing myself in the field of Data Storytelling, a decision driven by the realization that my selected academic paths demand both comprehensive data analysis and eloquent communication of results to a broad spectrum of stakeholders. I anticipate this course acting as a significant catalyst, not only complementing my existing technical prowess but also empowering me with refined proficiencies essential for excelling in the multifaceted environment of data-centric domains.
